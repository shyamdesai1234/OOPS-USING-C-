# Gen-AI Course Project

This project, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, explores concepts and practices related to generative AI. Below is a detailed breakdown of the notebook structure and its contents.

## Notebook Structure and Explanation

### Cell 1: Introduction (Markdown)
- Provides an overview of the project and objectives.

### Cell 2: Importing Libraries (Code)
- Imports essential Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model development.
- Key libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow, and others.

### Cell 3-5: Data Loading and Preprocessing (Code + Output)
- Loads the dataset using Pandas.
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), including:
  - Displaying dataset statistics.
  - Checking for null values and duplicates.
  - Basic visualizations of data distribution.

### Cell 6-10: Model Building (Code + Output)
- Builds and trains a machine learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Defines key model components:
  - Input preprocessing pipelines.
  - Model architecture and compilation.
- Trains the model and evaluates its performance on test data.

### Cell 11-13: Results and Insights (Markdown + Code + Output)
- Visualizes training metrics (e.g., accuracy and loss curves).
- Discusses insights and performance of the model.

### Final Cell: Conclusion (Markdown)
- Summarizes the project outcomes.
- Discusses potential improvements and future work.

## How to Use the Notebook
